# To Do

## Bug Fixes

* Ctrl+C/V/X when editing palettes interferes with regular cut/copy/paste somehow (worked around for now)

## Features

* Native-looking build on Mac OS X (issue [#8](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map/issues/8); involves publishing an app bundle release, and using the system menu bar)
* Scale the UI for high-DPI displays
* Generate map images from the command line (issue [#10](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map/issues/10))
* Allow undo/redo for resize and event operations
* Show a mini-palette of hotkeyed blocks, which the scroll wheel can cycle through

## Other Tools

* Map connection viewer
